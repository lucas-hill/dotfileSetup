# TODO

## Short Term
- [ ] Allow for the user to select the packages they want to install
- [ ] Allow the user to select the configuration files they want to be linked
- [ ] Set up symlinking the files to the correct directory
- [ ] Take the symlinking out of the installer and change it to consume the linker package to allow for these to be used independently

## Nice To Haves 
- [ ] Create a tag system that would allow for a quick installation using something like 'core' or 'terminal' to get everthing related to these tags installed and setup
- [ ] Name conflict detection for linked files
- [ ] Performing a merge of files that have the same name or are in the same spot. Would need to detect for duplicate variables/aliases in the files
- [ ] Snippets should not be repeated in multiple directories... There should be one snippets directory that should be shared with the other directories
